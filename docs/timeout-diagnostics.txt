Could docker logs be gathered on timeout and sent back to the browser.
Currently runner does this...

rescue Timeout::Error
  Process_kill_group(pid)
  Process_detach(pid)
  status = KILLED_STATUS
  timed_out = true
  ...
end

It could gather the logs before Process_kill_group()
It could send the log back as stderr!

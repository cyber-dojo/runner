If the docker-run used --read-only it would mean
all LTFs were using /tmp and /sandbox only.
That might make it possible to _recycle_ containers (per image).
Viz keep N containers alive in a cache and use docker-exec
instead of docker-run (is that really faster? if so how much? is it worth it?)

You'd need to clear out /tmp and /sandbox from a used container
before returning it to the cache.

They should be readonly for better security anyway...

What happens to tests with --read-only added...
Only 2 failures
TrafficLightTest
9DB Ubuntu L23
9DD Ubuntu L41
Access to the path /home/sandbox/.mono is denied.
--read-only And all tests pass :-)
Need to try on all LTFs...

Strongly suspect many Javascript node-based images will
require write access to their /etc/ install dir.

Step 0
Think about steps below in light of old-images (eg rarely used
custom-start-points). Should they fall back to using the
Ruby rag-lambdas?

Step 1
Migrate Ruby rag lambdas to Javascript.
Continue to make rag colour call inside the runner.
Just delegate to a node-based Javascript run_cyber_dojo_sh() call.

Step 2
Move Javascript lambdas from being stored in the manifest directly,
to being in a file named in the manifest.

Step 3
Make the Ruby rag lambda calls _and_ the Javascript browser calls
and verify they agree.

Step 4
Browser makes the call to model.ran_tests(....) rather than web controller.

Step 5
Stop making the Ruby rag lambda calls in runner.

Step 6
Delete rag lambdas from all language-start-point images.

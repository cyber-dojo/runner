Truncation

There are two different design decisions here:

 1) Network based truncation.

    It is the callers job to truncate incoming packets (for a
    run_cyber_dojo_sh call) if they wish to minimize network bandwidth.
    Ideally the caller should tell the runner this limit (eg in the manifest)
    so the runner can use the same limit on packets it is returning.
    Currently this is not implemented.

 2) File based truncation.

    The runner may choose to truncate incoming files before tar-piping
    them into the container.
    More importantly, any files created inside the container are harvested
    and the runner is responsible for truncating these.

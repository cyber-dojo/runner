Step 0
Think about steps below in light of old-images (eg rarely used
custom-start-points). They would need a fall-back... Perhaps
runner could be told whether to try and do rag call itself?
Could it determine that for itself? I think it could now that
runner_cyber_dojo_sh() accepts the manifest parameter.

Step 1
Migrate Ruby rag lambdas to Javascript.
Continue to make rag colour call inside the runner.
Just delegate to a node-based Javascript run_cyber_dojo_sh() call.
Don't like this because it makes each run_cyber_dojo_sh() call slower.

Step 2
Move Javascript lambdas from being stored in the manifest directly,
to being in a file named in the manifest.

Step 3
Make the Ruby rag lambda calls _and_ the Javascript browser calls
and verify they agree.

Step 4
Browser makes the call to kata/ran_tests()
which reaches web which in turn calls model.ran_tests(....)

Step 5
Stop making the Ruby rag lambda calls in runner.

Step 6
Delete rag lambdas from all language-start-point images.

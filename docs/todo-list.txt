readonly containers
-------------------
If the docker-run used --read-only it would mean
all LTFs were using /tmp and /sandbox only.
That might make it possible to recycle containers (per image).
You'd only really need to clear out /tmp and /sandbox.
They should be readonly for better security anyway...
What happens to tests with --read-only added...
Only 2 failures
TrafficLightTest
9DB Ubuntu L23
9DD Ubuntu L41
Access to the path /home/sandbox/.mono is denied.
--read-only And all tests pass :-)
Need to try on all LTFs...



RAG Lambdas in Python
--------------------
  - visible_files can contain red_amber_green.rb !!!!!
    If present, and different to cached source, then could use it inside
    a runner call that uses Ruby image. This opens up the option of
    allowing lambdas in other languages. Eg Python. Based on the extension.
    And use a known python image.

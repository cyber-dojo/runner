Try to get some output from B2B timedout test
---------------------------------------------
If using code from capture3_with_timeout.rb remember
that the docker run process spawned a process itself
(via the docker daemon). So remember to ensure docker-stop
is called before pipes are closed and read. Maybe do via
a block and yield to that.
Note that capture3_with_timeout does the Process.detach() _first_


readonly containers
-------------------
If the docker-run used --read-only it would mean
all LTFs were using /tmp and /sandbox only.
That might make it possible to recycle containers (per image).
You'd only really need to clear out /tmp and /sandbox.
They should be readonly for better security anyway...
What happens to tests with --read-only added...
Only 2 failures
TrafficLightTest
9DB Ubuntu L23
9DD Ubuntu L41
Access to the path /home/sandbox/.mono is denied.
--read-only And all tests pass :-)
Need to try on all LTFs...


Image_name:TAG
--------------
  - will now acts as key for cache holding the rag-lambdas.


RAG Lambdas in Python
--------------------
  - visible_files can contain red_amber_green.rb !!!!!
    If present, and different to cached source, then could use it inside
    a runner call that uses Ruby image. This opens up the option of
    allowing lambdas in other languages. Eg Python. Based on the extension.
    And use a known python image.


SMALLER
=======
logger.warning()?
logger.info()?
logger.error()?

rescue Errno::ESRCH ; 200;

TGZ exception test ; 500; add StdoutWriter

uncomment multi_os_test '62B'  Robustness

uncomment c_assert_test 'AB6   RackDispatcher

Dispatcher test that mimics config.ru setup
  Use BashStub.
  Make 2 calls
  Verify stub only gets asked to cat ragfile from image once.
  Delay doing this since call will probably end up as one Process.spawn()

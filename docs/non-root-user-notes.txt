Trying to use a non root user (called runner) when running the container...

# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Problem. Need permission to run /var/run/docker.sock
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

On DockerToolbox for Mac, on the default VM
/etc/group has docker group with gid=100
This means /var/run/docker.sock has a gid=100
On an Alpine image (such as this), /etc/group
has a group called users with gid=100
So I just need to make my runner user a member of users!
Obvious problem with this is that the docker group
has different gids on different OS's.
For example, on Ubuntu 16.04 (in Google Computer Engine)
/etc/group also has a group called users with gid=100
but its docker group has a gid of 999
I can hack-solve that by making the user a member
of _multiple_ groups, each of which has the gid for
docker on a particular OS

RUN adduser runner users

I'm working towards LTF images being tagged. eg
cyberdojofoundation/java_junit:23de45a

How will such images get docker pulled?
If an image is not present on the node then
docker-run will attempt to pull it.
This may succeed with the timeout for small Alpine images.
But, empirically, for large Ubuntu images there is not
enough time to download the image before the timeout.
Now, the image _layers_ may be small enough that each
[test] causes a docker-pull which gets the next layer
and eventually the image is downloaded.
But this is clearly not satisfactory.
And empirically it seems that some images have layers that
are sufficiently big that they never finish downloading.

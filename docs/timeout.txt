At the moment there is this

command = "docker stop --time 1 #{container_name}"
options = { timeout:4 }
result = capture3_with_timeout(@context, command, options)

It would be better as...

threader.thread do
  command = "docker stop --time 0 #{container_name}"
  stdout,stderr,status = @context.sheller.capture(command)
  ...
end

and then I can simplify capture3_with_timeout as it will
only need to support the main cyber_dojo_sh() call.

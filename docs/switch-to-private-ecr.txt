On branch: switch-to-using-private-ecr

$ make unit_test

Seems to be trashing this file:
  test/data/languages_start_points.manifests.json

Does languages-start-points service in docker-compose.yml
also need to be switched to run in a private ecr?
I don't think so.

Failing tests are all failing with common backtrace:
